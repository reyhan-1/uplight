This is a simple REST-API application. 

MVC like Architecture is implemented in the following approach: 
Controller -> Service -> Repository pattern is used.
This pattern separates the concerns. Testing, or adding new modules/functionalities is easier.

src 
    --- router // router folder is used to forward incoming traffic
    
    --- service //service folder is used for main logic

    --- test //test folder is used for integration&unit test

    --- utils //utils folder is used for common functions(utilities)

    -- .env //this file is used to store environment variables. Updating variables is faster and more efficient using env. Searching the code to update the variables can be time consuming.

To make sure code is consistently formatted Linter is used.  https://www.npmjs.com/package/linter 

INSTALLATION 
Install dependencies with npm install command. 
Then to run the main in the debugging mode in nodejs. 

Debug Console should output the following
/usr/local/bin/node ./main.js
Listening on port 8080.

TESTING  
for unit testing, Chai framework is used. https://www.npmjs.com/package/chai

Integration tests for the "/" endpoint is tested in the test/hmac_test.js 
run the integration test with run npm test command as shown in integration_testing.png

To test the data on postman send a POST request to http://localhost:8080 
Body should be in the following format 
{
    "data": "id=MDAwMDAwMDAtMDAwMC0wMDBiLTAxMmMtMDllZGU5NDE2MDAz"
}
